		<h3>Blockoid</h3>
		<p>Blockoid is a 2D sandbox game in development. Superficially, the game is similar to titles such as <i>Terraria</i> or <i>Minecraft</i>, but the aim of Blockoid is to provide a more dynamic world for the player, where danger and adventure do not sit statically in waiting for you! Instead, you may encounter monsters and adventurers roaming the world with their own goals, just as you do!</p>
		<p>This game is written entirely in pure Java. All art assets were drawn by myself.</p>
